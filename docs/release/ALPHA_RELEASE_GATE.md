- Summary CSV: `tools/perf/results/20260519T093010Z_gridftp-private-matrix-smoke-summary.csv`
- Fail count: `0`

Default baseline rows:

- direction=stor throughput_median=0.859850 spread_pct=34.448450

## Artifact Sync

- Manifest: `tools/perf/results/20260519T092826Z_alpha-artifacts.json`
- Artifacts: `1346`
- Sync: checked=`1347` synced=`3` missing=`0` mismatch=`0` pre_missing=`1` pre_mismatch=`2` post_missing=`0` post_mismatch=`0` status=`pass`
- Verify: checked=`1347` missing=`0` mismatch=`0` status=`pass`
- Local freshness: checked=`1346` stale=`0` status=`pass`

## Alpha Readiness

- Alpha scope is demonstrable GridFTP-like framed STOR/RETR, bidirectional resume, CRC32C chunk verification, and control metadata commands.
- Not beta/production: performance spread remains significant, 100G dedicated-line validation is not complete, and TLS/GSI/raw FTP stream/directory sync are out of scope.
- Defaults remain POSIX backend, full final verify, every_n_chunks manifest flush, no commit fsync, no preallocate full, and no default io_uring.

## Residual Process Check

- Local: ``
- Remote: ``

## Failures

- None.
